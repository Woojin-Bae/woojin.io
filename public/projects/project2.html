            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <p class="left">Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are gaining attention for promising energy-storage system by offering high energy capacities. However, LMBs face challenges in commercialization
                due to (1) its instability by irregular Li deposition such as Li dendrites and (2) energy density loss associated with the formation of “dead” lithium. These challenges are related to the
                Solid-Electrolyte Interphase (SEI) - a complex layer that forms because of interactions between lithium metal and electrolyte or salt. The SEI layer, which is formed with a thickness of
                several tens of nanometers, is difficult to observe because it is vulnerable to electron beam damage. The advance in cryogenic Transmission Electron Microscopy (cryo-TEM) have
                provided breakthrough opportunity to investigate the complex interface, minimizing electron beam damage even at high-resolution. Although many researches have employed cryo-
                TEM to enhance understanding of the SEI, a more holistic characterization remains necessary to unravel its intricate properties and its role in the performance limitations of LMBs. In
                this work, we developed an algorithm that can qualitatively analyze SEI layers in cryo-TEM images, which establishes systematic procedure for quantitative analysis of crystal
                composition and crystallinity within the SEI. Based on the remarkable methodology, we investigated the structural differences of the SEI formed on lithium with different morphologies
                (faceted Li, spherical Li) to identify the correlation between the morphology of lithium and the structure of the SEI. Also, a possible mechanism is proposed to elucidate the results,
                with a primary focus on how lithium deposition and its kinetics are influenced by the SEI thickness and composition.
